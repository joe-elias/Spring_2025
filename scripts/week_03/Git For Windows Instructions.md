# Download Instructions for Windows Git

## This will give access to the bash terminal, even though we wont be using git this week
 
 Download the Git for Windows [installer](https://gitforwindows.org/).
   
 Run the installer and follow the steps below:
   
    1. Click on "Next" four times (two times if you've previously installed Git). You don't need to change anything in the Information, location, components, and start menu screens.
    
    2. From the dropdown menu, "Choosing the default editor used by Git", select "Use Vim (the ubiquitous text editor) as Git's default editor" and click on "Next".
    
    3. On the page that says "Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories", ensure that "Let Git decide" is selected.
    
    4. Ensure that "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" is selected and click on "Next". (If you don't do this Git Bash will not work properly, requiring you to remove the Git Bash installation, re-run the installer and to select the "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software" option.)
    
    5. Select "Use bundled OpenSSH".
    
    6. Ensure that "Use the native Windows Secure Channel Library" is selected and click on "Next".
    
    7. Ensure that "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings" is selected and click on "Next".
    
    8. Ensure that "Use Windows' default console window" is selected and click on "Next".
    
    9. Ensure that "Default (fast-forward or merge) is selected and click "Next"
    
    10. Ensure that "Git Credential Manager" is selected and click on "Next".
    
    11. Ensure that "Enable file system caching" is selected and click on "Next".
    
    12. Click on "Install".
    
    13. Click on "Finish" or "Next"
